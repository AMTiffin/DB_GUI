# Description
Small GUI software for interfacing with Local DB to make my coworkers life easier.

# Log in
When launching the executable, you will encounter a login window that facilitates database connection. If you haven't received login credentials, please reach out to me, and I will provide the necessary information for program access. Kindly note that access to this program requires an existing user account in the database. Passwords are case-sensitive, and usernames are entered in all uppercase by default.
